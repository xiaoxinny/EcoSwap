# EcoSwap
### Brief Overview
EcoSwap is a simplistic, localized approach to solving the issues of reusing products, and waste management in communities.
<br> <br>
By facilitating and giving users a space to exchange or donate their products, we promote a closed loop cycle that permits maximization of a product's usability, before it gets safely discarded.
